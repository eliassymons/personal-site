This portfolio contains information about my background, education and software development experience. 

## Projects

I have three current projects listed: 

### Time Signatures

Built with ReactJS, this app is meant as a resource for music students and educators. 

The app randomly selects a piece of music. The user listens, and guesses a time signature. If they are correct, they proceed to the next musical selection. If they are incorrect, they must guess again until the correct answer is selected. 

### Cutting Board Site

This site utlizes ReactJS to display a basic landing page for a fictional company, Symons Woodshop. Includes an products section, an about section, and a contact form, using modern UI design. 

### National Parks

This site is a tool for people who want to learn more about the 400+ national parks and historical sites in the US. Rendered with React, the site fetches from the National Park API, generating a list of parks users can choose from. Then, after selecting a park, basic information and an image of the park is displayed, along with a link to the park's individual website.
