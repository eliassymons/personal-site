        <p>
          Since graduating with a degree in Piano Performance and Composition in
          2015, I've taught piano and scored music for commercials, short films,
          runway shows, and feature films. Last year, I decided it was time for
          a change. I wanted to pursue a career that was challenging and allowed
          me to express my creativity. Fast forward 8 months and I've learned
          the fundamentals of full stack development
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Express.js have been the focus of
          my studies. I feel confident that my skills will make me an asset as a
          fullstack or front-end developer.
